Password Generator

Technologies used - HTML, CSS, JavaScript

For an assignment, I was tasked to create the logic behind a password generator using JavaScript.

After clicking "Generate Password" the user is prompted to answer a series of questions - determining criteria for password generation.

As each criteria is determined, the user's choices are added to a "pool" of possible characters to randomize.

If an invalid option is chosen, the user is prompted with messages explaining the error. 

When all criteria are gathered, the password is generated from the pool of chosen characters and the output is displayed to the text area. 

The deployed app can be seen here: https://ubern00bie.github.io/passGen/
